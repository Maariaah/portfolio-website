# Portfolio website
Unique, personal portfolio website of a visual artist with a bit of an experimental approach.

## Getting started
Reusable website with changeable images. For using your own images in gallery, please go in **dist > assets** and make a new dir "images".
Make the **custom paths** in this directory for organising your own gallery thumbnails and large images, according to my paths in html.
