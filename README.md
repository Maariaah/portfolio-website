# Portfolio website
:sparkles:Unique, personal portfolio website of a visual artist with a bit of an experimental approach.:sparkles:

## Getting started
This website is reusable with changeable images. For using your own images in gallery, please go in **dist > assets** and make a new dir called "images".
Next, make the **custom paths** in this directory for organising your own gallery *thumbnails* and *large images*, according to my paths in HTML pages.
